# Vretta

Conversion / update of the fretta gamemode for Garry's Mod. Forked from Fretta13 by Jetboom.

Renamed to avoid conflicts with other fretta bases. Fretta gamemodes will have to be tweaked and
changed to use this base!!

## Update
Now includes Suicide Barrels code for an example.

## Notable Changes
- Player classes have been replaced with GM13's player manager module.
- GUI Fixes: help menu, scoreboard, player model selector.
- Spectator Fixes: removed spectator player class, fixed respawning as spectator.
- Fixed map voting to now use thumbnails!
- Cleaned up code.
- Cleaned some round logic.
