# Vretta

Conversion / update of the Fretta gamemode for Garry's Mod. Forked from Fretta13 by Jetboom.

Vretta is a heavily modified version of Fretta13, intended for new gamemodes.
Fretta13 gamemodes will have to be rewritten to use this base!

## Update
Now includes Suicide Barrels code for an example.

## Notable Changes
- Player classes have been replaced with GM13's player manager module.
- GUI Fixes: help menu, scoreboard, player model selector.
- Fixed long standing team switching, and spawning issue.
- Spectator Fixes: removed spectator player class, fixed respawning as spectator.
- Fixed map voting to now use thumbnails!
- Cleaned up code.
- Cleaned some round logic.
